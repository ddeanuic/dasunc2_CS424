      <h3>
        Introduction and Description
      </h3>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Project 1 is an application that allows users to compare the ridership data on 3 different CTA 'L' Stations. The users will be able
        to compare the ridership data through a visualization in the form of bar graphs. The 3 stations that were chosen for this application are:
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px"> 
        <strong style="font-size: 18px">-UIC-Halsted</strong>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 18px">-O'Hare Airport</strong>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 18px">-LaSalle</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
          When first opening the application, the user will notice 4 elements on the screen. These 4 elements on the screen are 3 bar graphs and
          a table. Each of the elements are positioned in their own quadrant on the screen. For each of the bar graphs, the user will notice that
          there are 3 different drop down menus that are associated for each bar graph. The drop down menus for each of the bar graphs function
          the exact same way but their functions only apply to the bar graph they are associated with. The 3 drop down menus are self explanationary
          and their following functions are: 
      </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px"> 
        <strong style="font-size: 18px">1.) What station to visualize the data on</strong>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 18px">2.) What specific year of the chosen station to visualize</strong>
        <br>
        <strong style="font-size: 18px">3.) What data the user wants to see based on the first two parameters: e.g. # of daily rides, # of rides per month, # rides per week, or # of rides per year</strong>

        </figure>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        By default, the application will show the # of rides per year for the 3 different CTA 'L' Stations. 
        The user can start using the application by changing any of the parameters bar graphs. The user can do many things with this application. 
        The user can initially compare the number of rides per year each stations has. If the user changes the year of one of the graphs but the 
        the graph is still selected to show the yearly total, then no changes will appear on the screen. However, if a different visualization of
        the year is chosen e.g. Daily Rides, then the application will immediately format and visualize the on that specific graph. When changing
        a parameter, the user will notice that the graphs may look different. The reason for this is the application is dynamically changing the 
        y-axis limits for each of the graph. For example, if only one of the graphs is showing monthly rides for a given year, then the y-axis limits
        for that graph should cater to that data so that it is easier for the user to tell the # of rides for that station. However, if there are 2 
        graphs showing monthly rides, then the application will change the y-axis limits to the highest value between the graphs with the same 
        visualization type. This allows the user to clearly compare the # of rides by simply looking at the height of the bar graph.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        The last element of the application is the table. The table contains 3 different tabs that correspond to each of the bar graphs.
        The table for each graph shows the data that is being visualized for the chosen table. This gives the user the ability to closely look at 
        the data that is being visualized.

        Data and Data Manipulation/Processing
      </h3>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        This project utilizes public data that has been collected and provided by the Chicago Transit Authority. The data on the CTA 'L' Stations date
        all the way back to 2001. A preview of the data can be seen below:
        <br>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/project1/asset3.png" alt="Figure 2" class = "center">
            <figcaption class = "center">Figure 2: Table Preview of Data. Data and Image from <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-L-Station-Entries-Daily-Totals/5neh-572f">data.cityofchicago.org</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        As can be seen in Figure 2, the data contains 5 attributes. These attributes are the station id, station name, date, day type, and the number of rides.
        For this project we were only interested in 3 of the attributes which are the station name, date, and the number of rides.
        The data manipulation for this project was actually very simple since the most complicated manipulation we had to do on the data was summation for the total
        number of rides given the chosen method to visualize the data. To understand how the application delivers the visualization, we can go through the steps 
        taken on how the data was manipulated
        <br>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        The first step was to assign the raw data from the Chicago Transit Authority to a data frame in R. Once we have converted the raw data into a data frame,
        we are able to filter the data for the stations that we want. In this case, we create 3 new data frames that contain only data from the stations from
        UIC-Halsted, O'Hare Airport, and LaSalle. Before we can use the data, we create a more usable date format for each data frame. After this process, the data
        is ready to be further manipulated so that it can be used for the visualizations.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        There are four different ways the data can be visualized for each station. The first way is the # of rides a day for the chosen year. For this type of visualization,
        there is actually no further manipulation that is needed in order to visualize the data by day. The reason is that the filtered data for UIC-Halsted, O'Hare, or LaSalle
        contains the dates of every single day that the station was in operation and the number of rides there are per day. So we can simply plot the data where x is our 
        new date format and y as the number of rides.
        <br><br>
        The second visualization type is # of rides per weekday. In order to visualize this, we first have to create a new data frame with a new attribute that indicates what
        weekday a given entry is.
        This was done by applying the weekday() function on the new date we created e.g. "weekday(dataFrame$newDate)". Now that we know what day each of the week each entry is,
        we can use the aggregate() function with the application of the sum function to get the total # of rides for each day of the week given the year. After that, we can plot data.
        <br><br>
        The third visualization type is # of rides per month. In order to visualize this, we have to create a new data frame that contains the total number of rides there are 
        for each month. This was done the same was for the # of rides per weekday where we utilize the aggregate function that specifically targets the month of our date attribute.
        After that, we have a new data frame that contains the total number of rides per month given the chosen year. We can go ahead and plot.
        <br><br>
        The last visualization type is # of rides per year. Getting this data is very similar to the # of rides per weekday and # of rides per month.
        Again, we have to create a new data frame where we utilize the aggregate function that specifically targets the year of our date attribute. After that, we have a new
        data frame that contains the total number of rides per year. We can go ahead and plot.
        <br><br>
        As mentioned, the data manipulations was not complicated at all because all we are doing is creating summations based on day, weekday, month, or year.

        Interesting Observations on the Data
      </h3>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Straight away, based on the default state of the application (total # of rides per year for each of the available stations to choose from), we can clearly see
        how much busier O'Hare Airport station is compared to the UIC-Halsted or LaSalle. This of course is not really a surprise because people that travel need to
        get to O'Hare Airport or leave the airport. Besides this obvious observation, we can see on the default state of the application the impact COVID-19 has on
        CTA's subway ridership.
        <br>

            <img src="assets/project1/asset5.png" alt="Figure 3" class = "center">
            <figcaption class = "center">Figure 3: Dip in ridership caused by COVID-19</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        Based on Figure 3, we can see that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic has affected all 3 stations. This dip is ridership is due to the fact that it is
        dangerous to take public transportation during a pandemic due to the risk of getting infected. In addition, we can see that at least for O'Hare Airport that from
        2020 to 2021, there is a slight increase in ridership. This is most likely due to the fact that the riders have more knowledge on what precautions to take in order 
        to make public transportation as safe as possible giving them more confidence to take this mode of transportation. The last COVID-19 related observation we can look 
        at is the ridership of the UIC-Halsted station during 2020 and 2021.
        <br>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/project1/asset6.png" alt="Figure 4" class = "center">
            <figcaption class = "center">Figure 4: Students at UIC switch to remote learning </a></figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        A majority of UIC-Halsted riders are students attending University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC).
        We can see from Figure 4 when UIC initialized remote learning in order to stop the spread of COVID-19 on Campus. We can specifically pin point on the left bar graph 
        that around April is when UIC stopped all on-campus operations and switched to remote learning due to Governor Pritzker's extension of the stay-at-home order.
        This was consistently until Fall of 2021 where we can see that the ridership for UIC-Halsted has increased due to the fact the UIC has begun reinstating on-campus 
        learning with the condition that students were vaccinated and had to always wear masks.
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        The last observation we are going to look at is the ridership trend per weekday.
        <br>
        <figure>
            <img src="assets/project1/asset7.png" alt="Figure 5" class = "center">
            <figcaption class = "center">Figure 5: Weekday Ridership Trend </a></figcaption>
        </figure>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 18px">
        As we can see from Figure 5, despite COVID-19 affecting UIC-Halsted ridership in 2021, the ridership trend is still consistent with the ridership trend with 
        other stations throughout the week. We can confirm this by looking at LaSalle station for 2018 before COVID-19 started. We can see that there are significantly
        more riders during the weekday but on the weekends, the ridership numbers go down. We can attribute this to the fact that people go to work using this mode of
        transportation during the weekday and less people use this transportation on the weekend because riders are at home / not going to work or going to school.
        <br>
        <br>
        These are just some of the interesting things that we can observe from the application.
